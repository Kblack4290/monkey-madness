<!-- # Activity 6 - GitHub Pages Project Webpage

In this activity you'll practice creating github pages with projects. You'll build a website about your favorite type of animal!

### Instructions

Make a simple website about your favorite type of animal.

* Create a header that will act as a title for the page
* Create a few short paragraphs describing the animal's best characteristics. 
* Include at least one picture of the animal

* Once you have created your HTML add, commit, and push your files up to GitHub Pages.
  * Make sure to navigate to your page in the web browser to ensure your website is live

### Guide

1. Create a new repository on your GitHub account. *You can name this repository whatever you would like.*
2. Once inside of the repository, create a new file and name it `index.html`
3. Add your HTML into this file, save it, and then navigate into your repository's `Settings` tab.
4. Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section and then, in the section labeled `Source`, select that you would like to use the `main` branch as your source.
5. Navigate to `<<YOUR USERNAME>>.github.io/<<REPO NAME YOU CHOSE>>` and you will find that your new web page has gone live! (For example, if your GitHub username is `johndoe` and the project is `cssDemo`, your URL would be `johndoe.github.io/cssDemo`) 

### Bonuses

* See if you can use your personal site from the previous activity as a portfolio that can be used to show off all of the work you have done in the past. Update it to link to this activity's site.
* Try to create a navigation system which links from your personal website to this new animal site and vice-versa.
* Have some fun! Test your HTML and CSS skills by going above and beyond with your page! -->

            <h2> About</h2>

            <p>
                Monkeys live all over the world and come in various shapes, sizes and colors. As one of our closest
                relatives, these mammals are very intelligent and have opposable thumbs, allowing them to use tools and
                play games.

            <p>
                There are more than 260 different types of monkeys. They are separated into two major categories: New
                World and Old World. The New World monkeys live in the Americas, while Old World monkeys live in Asia
                and Africa. One difference between the two categories is that Old World monkeys don't have prehensile
                tails; New World monkeys do. Old World monkeys have special pouches in their cheek where they can store
                food. Old World monkeys have rump pads, but New World monkeys do not. Also, Old World monkeys' nostrils
                are small and curved and set close together; most New World monkeys have round nostrils set far apart
